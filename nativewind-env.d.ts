/// <reference types="nativewind/types" />

// If you're using TypeScript in your project, you'll need to set up the type definitions.
// Nativewind extends the React Native types via declaration merging. 
// The simplest method to include the types is to create a new nativewind-env.d.ts file and add a triple-slash directive referencing the types.
